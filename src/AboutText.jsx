            <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
            <p>I am an illustrator and concept artist based in Montr√©al, Canada. </p>
           <p> I've worked as a freelance artist for over 5 years.
            Although my favourite subjects are environments and backgrounds, I also enjoy creating characters and props.
